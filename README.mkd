# Soolr

Soolr is a library for constructing Solr queries using an
object-oriented API. It is a (conceptual) extraction from the
[Sunspot](http://github.com/outoftime/sunspot) library, but unlike Sunspot,
it makes no assumptions about how you want to use Solr.

The planned 2.0 release of Sunspot will be built on top of this library.

This is very much a work in progress. Contributions are welcome!
